# The Shortest Common Superstring Problem (SCSP)

The Shortest Common Superstring Problem is a well-known problem in computer science that involves finding the shortest possible string that contains all the given strings as substrings. In other words, it asks to merge multiple strings into one by overlapping them as much as possible while minimizing the length of the resulting string.

This problem has many applications in various fields, such as DNA sequencing, text compression, and data mining. It is also a challenging problem in computational complexity theory, as it is NP-complete, meaning that it is unlikely to have an efficient algorithm that solves it for all instances.

One approach to solving the Shortest Common Superstring Problem is to use a brute-force algorithm that considers all possible ways of overlapping the given strings and selects the one with the shortest length. However, this approach quickly becomes impractical as the number of strings increases.

Another approach is to use heuristic algorithms that provide approximate solutions to the problem by exploiting some properties of the problem instance. These algorithms include greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and genetic algorithms.

In this GitHub repository, you can find implementations of various algorithms for solving the Shortest Common Superstring Problem in different programming languages. The repository also includes examples of how to use these algorithms to solve practical problems and benchmark their performance on various instances of the problem.
